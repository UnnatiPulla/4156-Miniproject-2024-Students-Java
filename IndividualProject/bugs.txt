FILE NAME               BUGS                                                                                           INFO
Course.java             getCourseLocation() and getInstructorName() had swapped return values.                         Found out via failing unit tests that I created.
Course.java             getEnrolledStudentCount() method is missing. There is no getter for a crucial value.
Course.java             No getters for enrollment capacity. This leads to difficulty in debugging                      Found out while adding a test case - isCourseFullTest()
                        and maintenance.
Course.java             isCourseFull() was returning the wrong value. It was returning
                        capacity > enrolledStudentCount instead of capacity <= enrolledStudentCount
Course.java             enrollStudent() was not doing what it is supposed to do as described in the javadoc
Course.java             enrolledStudentCount field was being initialized as 500, but it should start from 0.
Course.java             dropStudent() was not performing the actions as described in javadoc.

Department.java         in method getNumberOfMajors(), there was a typo that returned -this.numberOfMajors
                        instead of this.numberOfMajors.
Department.java         in method getDepartmentChair(), there was a typo that returned "this.departmentChair"
                        instead of this.departmentChair.
Department.java         addPersonToMajor() is the wrong name for the method. Based on the javadoc, it is supposed
                        to be incrementMajorCount()
Department.java         dropPersonFromMajor() is the wrong name for the method. Based on the javadoc, it is supposed
                        to be decrementMajorCount(). Small check i.e., if(numberOfMajors > 0) { numberOfMajors--; }
                        to check major count is to be added based on javadoc too.
Department.java         The method createCourse() needs to be renamed to createAndAddCourse() based on the javadoc.
Department.java         toString returned "result.toString()" instead of result.toString()                              Found out while writing unit tests
RouteController.java    in retrieveDepartment(), HTTP status code/responses were swapped. We are supposed to return
                        200 code for the case where we are able to successfully retrieve and NOT FOUND in case we
                        did not find. It was incorrectly swapped.
RouteController.java    in retrieveCourse(), when we are able to successfully retrieve the course we were incorrectly
                        returning http status code of FORBIDDEN. It is supposed to be OK
RouteController.java    in getMajorCtFromDept(), before departmentMapping.getCode(), there was a '-' character.
                        This needs to be removed since it is a typo and will lead to errors since getCode()
                        returns an object and negating it with a '-' does not make sense.
RouteController.java    in findCourseTime() method, while displaying the retrieved course time, the method incorrectly
                        displays "some time" instead of requestedCourse.getCourseTimeSlot().
