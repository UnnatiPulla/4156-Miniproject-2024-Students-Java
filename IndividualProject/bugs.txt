Course.java             getCourseLocation() and getInstructorName() had swapped return values.                 Found out via failing unit tests that I created.
Course.java             getEnrolledStudentCount() method is missing. There is no getter for a crucial value.
Course.java             No getters for enrollment capacity. This leads to difficulty in debugging              Found out while adding a test case - isCourseFullTest()
                        and maintenance.
Course.java             isCourseFull() was returning the wrong value. It was returning
                        capacity > enrolledStudentCount instead of capacity <= enrolledStudentCount
Course.java             enrollStudent() was not doing what it is supposed to do as described in the javadoc
Course.java             enrolledStudentCount field was being initialized as 500, but it should start from 0.
Course.java             dropStudent() was not performing the actions as described in javadoc.
